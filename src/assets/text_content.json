      "description": "I wanted a place where I had more control over how I presented myself, so I learned how to implement popular frameworks like React, Tailwind, and GSAP to create an interactive, animated website. It gives me a place to explain what my projects are, why I did them, and what I learned from them.",
      "motivation": "As previously mentioned, my motivation for this project was to give myself a place to present my work in a visually appealing, widely accessible way. I've always been interested in user interaction, so it was also an excuse to teach myself new skills commonly used for UX.",
      "roadblocks": "Before starting this website, I had zero experience with JavaScript, CSS, or HTML, and did not know how they interacted to form a website. Luckily, the internet is chalked full of useful graphics, tutorials, and examples that helped guide me through the learning process. After watching a few videos that explained the basics of the dynamics between these three languages and following a few tutorials on the development frameworks React, Tailwind, and GSAP, I decided to start implementing my knowledge to create this website. There were struggles as I learned how to interface between the different frameworks, but I was able to overcome them by reading through the documentation and searching through online forums for answers.",
      "lessons": "While not the most technically challenging, this project reminded me of the importance of starting. I often struggle with scope creep, and it causes me to give up on a project during the brainstorming phase because I get overwhelmed by everything I want to do. Understanding that the first version is not the last and that you can always revise is an important concept in engineering that this project reminded me of.",
